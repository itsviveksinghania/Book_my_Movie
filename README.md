# Book My Movie
## Project Description:

The Spring Boot project is designed to create a movie ticket booking system that allows users to book movie tickets for a particular showtime at a specific theatre. The project consists of several functionalities that include adding users, adding movies, adding theatres, adding shows, booking tickets and utilizing MySQL as the database.

The application provides a user-friendly interface to add new users with details such as name, email, and contact number. The system can also add movies and their details such as the movie name, director, cast, genre, release date, and runtime. The project allows the addition of theatre information, including theatre name, address, capacity, and location. The system can also add show details, such as show timings, available seats, and the ticket price.

The application's primary focus is to provide an easy-to-use platform for movie ticket bookings. Users can search for movies, theatres, and shows to make bookings. The application provides a secure and efficient ticket booking system that ensures smooth and hassle-free bookings. The system also allows users to cancel or reschedule their bookings and provides refunds as per the terms and conditions.

## Development Scope:

Several features can be added to this Spring Boot project to make it more versatile and user-friendly. Some of the enhancements are:

Payment Gateway Integration: Integrating a secure payment gateway to the application will enable users to make payments online, thereby making the booking process much smoother.

Movie and Theatre Ratings: Users can rate movies and theatres, which will provide other users with useful information while making bookings.

SMS/Email Notifications: The system can be enhanced to send SMS or email notifications to users regarding their bookings, cancellations, and refunds.

Social Media Integration: The system can be integrated with social media platforms to enable users to share their bookings on social media, thereby increasing the application's popularity.

Analytics Dashboard: A dashboard that provides detailed analytics and reports on the number of bookings, popular movies, popular shows, and revenue generated can be added to provide valuable insights.

Mobile Application: Developing a mobile application for the platform will make it more accessible and provide an enhanced user experience.

Overall, the Spring Boot project is an excellent platform for developing a robust and efficient movie ticket booking system. With the addition of the above features, the system will provide a seamless and hassle-free experience to the users.
